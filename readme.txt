Hello kind grader, code for this project can be found here: https://github.com/bjs250/CS7641-PS2

It's written to be compatible with Python Version 3.8.0, and you can install the libraries to run it in your virtual
environment from reqs.txt

The code here is thrown together and not well organized so I'm praying for you if you dive in

The following three files, when ran, generate a ton of csv files that go to the appropriate output subdir:
continuouspeaks.py
kcolors.py
tsp.py

You can run hyperparameter tuning experiments with hyperparameter_plotting.py and by changing a bunch of toggle flags
plotting_utils.py were used to generate most figures.

The neural network code is in
NN.py
NNplotting.pt


I actually didn't steal a lot of code this time, it's basically a straight rip from the mlrose-hiive examples
